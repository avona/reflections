What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 When a repository is initialized using 'git init' the .git file is created that contains the 
 metadata about the initialized git directory. Initialization of a git directory is needed
 for starting keeping track of the changes made to the files within that repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

 The staging area is the intermediate step between adding files to commit and the repository.
 The staging area is like a buffer, i.e. it allows adding more files into a "bucket" before
 making a single commit.
