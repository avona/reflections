When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  A remote repository is useful for storing the commits online so that it's not dependant
  on a particular computer. A remote repository given access can be accessible from any
  computer/location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
  Manually pulling commits allows developers to keep track of what has been changed in
  a particular repository. Automatic updates of the Git repository may complicate the
  tracking of the changes.
