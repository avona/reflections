When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  A remote repository is useful for storing the commits online so that it's not dependant
  on a particular computer. A remote repository given access can be accessible from any
  computer/location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  
  Manually pulling commits allows developers to keep track of what has been changed in
  a particular repository. Automatic updates of the Git repository may complicate the
  tracking of the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

  Forks is used for cloning the remote repository into another remote repository in Github.
  While clones are used for copying the remote/local repository into another local 
  repository. Branches are used for copying an existing repository withing the same repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  Storing the latest copy of the remote locally eliminates the possibility of future
  manual resolving of conflicts when merging two branches.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what
would be harder?

  Collaborating without Git or GitHub would be a bit harder. I would opt either for
  another CVSs or just manually save every major version of changes and share it with
  other collaborators. It would be harder to compare the differences of the files and
  sharing them without Git. Nothing comes to my mind that would make collaboration
  easier without Git or GitHub.
